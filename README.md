Hi! My Name Samuel M. Arceo, you can call me Sam, and I am a BSIT graduate. Since the start of my journey in the IT sector, Iâ€™ve become fascinated with programming languages. 

I really like to learn Web Development, that is why I always watch video tutorials about it. Aside from programming, I also love music, hence, I am a musician and I play drums as my main instrument. I can play other instruments as well.

My goal for this year is to get a job as a Web Developer.

I want to have a career while doing the things that I love, and I am priviledged that Web Development is a high-paying career and at the same time, I love building websites.
